                <h2>Places to visit</h2>
                <p>Don't confuse <span class="cityName">Siracusa</span> for a city of braggarts if the terms "oldest," "biggest," and "best preserved" keep cropping up
                    in descriptions of its many tourist attractions. These superlatives are well-earned by a city that has one of the largest
                    theatres in the entire ancient Greek world, catacombs far larger than those in Rome, one of Italy's largest Roman amphitheatres,
                    and one of the most complete and strongest fortifications remaining from the Greek era. Add to those a cathedral with one
                    entire wall formed by the columns of an ancient Temple to Athena, Sicily's second most important archaeological museum, and
                    fascinating quarries where Greeks and Romans found the stones for enormous ancient complexes,
                    and you can see why Syracuse is high on any list of must-see places in Sicily.</p>

                    <p>The Arenella beach fits in any touristic needs: it's very big and it's made of  light and fine sand.
                        The bathing establishment offers the possibility of renting beach umbrellas and sunbeds, canoes and pedalo. There is also
                        a new-built big resort. The beach is well-equipped, with a bar and restaurant. On the left hand side of the
                        establishment there is a small public beach and a solarium built on the sea. On the right hand side
                        there is a beautiful public beach and few meters further there's a rock beach.</p>

                    <img src="media/rsz_maniace.jpg" alt="Maniace Castle">
                    <p>The Castle of Federico II in Siracusa, then called Maniace, was built between the 1232 and the 1240. The first documents on its foundation are the
                        letters that Federico sent on the 17 November of the 1239 from Lodi to his subordinates relating to the construction of the castle, in which the
                        emperor welcomes the diligence with which Riccardo from Lentini prepositus aedificiorum follows the castrum nostrum Siracusa.</p>

                    <img src="media/rsz_cathedral.jpg" alt="Cathedral">
                    <p>In the upper side of Ortigia island, the site where stands the Cathedral of Syracuse was intended, since ancient times,
                        to be a place to worship. A temple built in the sixth century BC, it was replaced by the Temple of Athena (or Minerva),
                        built in honor of the goddess of the tyrant Gelone, after the great victory of Himera (480 BC) against the Carthaginians.
                        In the seventh century, at the time of Bishop Zosimo, the temple of Athena was incorporated into a Christian church dedicated
                        to the Nativity of Mary: in particular, walls were erected to close the space between the columns of the peristyle and eight
                        arches were opened, in the central cell, to allow the passage of the two aisles.</p>

                    <h3>Greek Theatre</h3>
                    <img src="media/rsz_theatre.jpg" alt="Greek Theatre">
                    <p>The Greek Theatre is the greatest example of greek theatre of the West. It has the distinction of being almost entirely excavated
                        in the rock. In addition to performances, it was the custom for the ancient Greeks, the theatre was used for popular assemblies.
                        After being adapted to games in the imperial era circus, the theatre fell into disuse. In the sixteenth century, as well as other
                        classical monuments, was plundered by the Spanish masters of Charles V, who used the good stone has already been cut to build the
                        fortifications of Ortigia.</p>
