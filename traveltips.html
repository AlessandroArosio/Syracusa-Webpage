        <h2>Useful travel information</h2>
        <section class="tips">
            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>In urban centres and around tourist attractions, you will find many Italians who can speak English at a functional level.
                However, learning a few words of Italian will be polite and will help smooth your path. Outside the main tourist centres,
                a phrase book will be useful and swotting up on some Italian in advance could add immeasurably to your holiday experience.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="tips">
            <h3>Tipping</h3>
            <p>Tipping isn't widespread in Italy. At restaurant meals Italians will generally leave a euro or two as a tip, although it is not
                usual to tip in family-run businesses where you are waited on by the proprietors. Waiters will be aware that foreigners are likely
                to tip more generously, but it is up to you how much you give. I tend to leave around 10%. Occasionally in touristy restaurants, service will be added to the bill, sometimes at an extortionate rate - check the menu in advance. It is normal for a cover charge (coperto) - typically â‚¬2 per person - to be added to a bill; this should be stated on menus. In smarter hotels, if a porter shows you to your room they will be glad of a tip, but that is at the guest's discretion.</p>

            <h3>Problem and emergencies</h3>
            <p>112 is an emergency number that will work across the EU, with the capacity for answering calls in a number of languages.
                Italy also has its own national number for emergencies: 113. Italy has several police forces with different functions.
                The ones you are mostly likely to see are the state police, the local town and municipal police, and the smartly-uniformed carabinieri,
                a military police force. Any of them should help you in an emergency.
                If you lose your passport, need advice or run into serious trouble, contact your embassy.
                For lesser problems, hotel receptionists and local people can be a helpful source of information, directions and advice. Hotel receptionists
                will usually speak some English, have local knowledge, and be equipped with the contact details of doctors, hospitals, taxis and so on.
                Always carry hotel's address and phone number in case you encounter problems or get lost.

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>One of the main reasons for the lazy lunch hour is the climate. In summer most parts of Italy can get uncomfortably hot,
                and it is best to avoid much activity in the middle of the day. In the winter, the north of Italy and all the country's mountainous
                areas are cold and can be snowy. Travellers should check a weather forecast and average temperatures before departure, and be prepared for the likely weather.</p>

            <h3>Monday closures</h3>
            <p>Monday is the traditional day of closure for museums and heritage sites. There are some exceptions, but generally you shouldn't rely
                on being able to visit any archaeological site, museum or gallery on a Monday. The vast majority are open every day from Tuesday to Sunday,
                but it is always advisable to check in advance. Many shops are also closed on Monday mornings.</p>
