            <h3>The greatest Greek city and the most beautiful of them all (Cit. Marcus Tullius Cicero)</h3>
            <p>Once one of ancient Greece’s most important cities, today <span class="cityName">Syracuse</span> (Siracusa in Italian) is a lively town of about 125,000 on Sicily’s southeast coast.
                The city overflows with amazing remnants from its long history. Romans, Vandals and Normans are few of those who ruled here after the Greeks.
                In <span class="cityName">Syracuse</span>’s harbor, <span class="cityName">Ortigia</span> Island (also called Città Vecchia or Old City) is the site of many of the main attractions,
                including the seventh-century cathedral and the Fountain of Aretusa.</p>

                    <p>This place makes me think of Venice (ok, without the canals) but with a totally different architecture, baroque and with very light colours. It's amazing.
                        The main square is a masterpiece of art and architecture, and the icing of the cake is the cathedral.
                        It's built on an ancient temple which has still got its columns and inner structure intact.
                        Practically like traveling through time and three different eras when you are standing inside. AMAZING.</p>

                    <p>Ortigia is beautiful. Simple as that. It is the traditional heart of Siracusa and actually an island separated from Sicily by a very narrow (maybe 10m)
                        channel that is covered with bridges. White marble baroque architecture predominates. The place has layers of history from Archimedes when it was a Greek city
                        to its golden age under the Hapsburgs. It is always lively but never over busy. Filled with very cool jazz bars and it has one of the best fresh markets anywhere.
                        These days avoid the tourist trap restaurants that dominate around Aretusa's Fountain and go for the local bars and "trattorias" that are everywhere around the
                        town serving very high quality but inexpensive Sicilian cuisine. It is a bit like Venice in that whilst it has stellar attractions the best thing to do is hang
                        out relax and take in the beauty of the place. Don't do a day trip here, come for several nights. It isn't a tour place.
                        Following a crowd around you will never appreciate the true beauty. For that you have to sit through the twilight in the evening in Piazza Duomo
                        or on the public wharf drinking cocktails or Sicilian wine and eating local cuisine (the pizza is good but so is much else) and just watching the locals stroll
                        and children play in some of the most beautiful scenery in Italy.</p>
